# Phase One: Confirm research conclusions in google colab
/phaseone

# Phase Two:
Apply lessons in Phase One to the plankton data set. Compare with naive rnn.
(We are here)

# Phase Three: Generalize binary quantum classifier 
In this phase, we devise a generalization that maps to images containing 0-9.

# Phase Four : Apply general quantum classifier to plankton dataset
In this phase, we perform the generalized algorithm on the plankton dataset and compare to the deep learning approach found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05258.pdf).
