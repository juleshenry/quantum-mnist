This project seeks to confirm results published in https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume11No10/Paper_40-Handwritten_Numeric_Image_Classification.pdf

We will explore quantum image processing via plankton data set found in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05258.pdf√ü

# Phase One: Confirm research conclusions in google colab

# Phase Two:
Apply lessons in Phase One to the plankton data set. We will look at the cartesian product comparison of binary classification via the "fair" 4x4 neural net. Do the same for the quantum scenario.

We need to convert the plankton dataset to grayscale. We do so using the 			
(We are here)

# Phase Three: Generalize binary quantum classifier 
In this phase, we devise a generalization that maps to images containing 0-9.

# Phase Four : Apply general quantum classifier to plankton dataset
In this phase, we perform the generalized algorithm on the plankton dataset and compare to the deep learning approach found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05258.pdf).
