# Phase One: Confirm research conclusions locally

(We are here)

# Phase Two: Generalize binary quantum classifier 
In this phase, we devise a generalization that maps to images containing 0-9.


# Phase Three : Apply heuristics to plankton dataset
In this phase, we perform the generalized algorithm on the plankton dataset and compare to the deep learning approach found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05258.pdf).
